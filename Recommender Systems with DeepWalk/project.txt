In this project, we will revisit the problem central to recommender systems: predicting a userâ€™s preference for some item they have not yet rated. Like the Spark recommender from the first project, we will use a collaborative filtering model to explore this problem. Recall that in this model, the goal is to find the sentiment of a user about a particular item.
